# Graphs
graphs is a non-linear DS similar of trees

contains:
1. nodes/ vertices
2. edges: to connect each node with another node/nodes

## graph types
1. directed

each node connect with others with directed edge which means there is one way to traverse

Ex: in below example

    - node A traverse to B only
    - node B traverse to D only
    - node C traverse to E only
    - node D traverse to A only
    - node E traverse to D only

2. un-directed

each node connect with others with un-directed edge which means there are many ways to traverse between 2 connected nodes

Ex: in below example

    - node A traverse to B and E
    - node B traverse to D and C
    - node C traverse to B and D
    - node D traverse to B and E
    - node E traverse to D and A

3. weighted

each edge has a weight/ value
this weight will consider when you traverse from nodes

(you can imagin it as a distance between 2 cities so if i want to move from city A to city B i am going to take the shortest path ^^)
</b>

4. un-weighted

each edge does not have a weight/ value
 
<p style='color:#064663'><b>
(it is like a normal graph ^^)
</b>

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

1. complete:

A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes

2. connected vs dis-connected

<b style='color:#E5890A'>A connected graph </b>is graph that has all of nodes have at least one edge.

<b style='color:#E5890A'>A disconnected graph </b>is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Adjacency Matrix
An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

- The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isnâ€™t a connection.

## Adjacency List

An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

## so HOW to Traverse graph?

1. **Breadth First Algorithm**


        ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
            DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
            DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
            DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

        breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
        visited.Add(vertex)

        while (breadth is not empty)
            DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
            nodes.Add(front)

            for each child in front.Children
                if(child is not visited)
                    visited.Add(child)
                    breadth.Enqueue(child)   

        return nodes;

2. **Depth First Algorithm**

        procedure DFS_iterative(G, v) is
            let S be a stack
            S.push(iterator of G.adjacentEdges(v))
            while S is not empty do
                if S.peek().hasNext() then
                    w = S.peek().next()
                    if w is not labeled as discovered then
                        label w as discovered
                        S.push(iterator of G.adjacentEdges(w))
                else
                    S.pop()
