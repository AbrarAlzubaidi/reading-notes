# JSX
way to type html tags inside javascript 


-----


# React
- React : is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

- JSX for React “elements”.
-  React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other.
- React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components”
- React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful
- React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes
- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
- components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
- Components can refer to other components in their output
- All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

## Architecture beyond HTML

- The basic architecture of React applies beyond rendering HTML in the browser. 

## React hooks
- Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

- React provides a few built-in hooks like useState, useContext, useReducer and useEffect. Others are documented in the Hooks API Reference. 


# Next.js
- a JavaScript framework
- lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React
- Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

    - An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
    - Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
    - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
    - Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
    - Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
    - Development environment with Fast Refresh support
    - API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
    - Fully extendable
