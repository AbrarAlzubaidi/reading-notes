# the dif between Pain and Suffering:
as Benjamin Franklin said "No pain No gain" 
üòâ

so "The greater the growth, the greater the pain".
if you need to acheive s.th it dont mean that it will be free you have to pay s.th, Regardless of the type of payment(except health)

Suffering is the pain without any result or purpose.

for me when i ask myself about how i was and how i am now ya i feel different. after the journy of 4 months ya i improved ‚ù§Ô∏è
and i liked this sentence "You are building your value ^^"

# big O, what is it?
it is to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.(worst case)and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used

### big O types:
1. O(1): a statement will execute one time
2. O(n): a statement will execute more than one time will execute nth of time.
**notes** 

     - n is a integer number 
     - usually it descriped loops perfo.
     - ex: Linear Search

3. O(n power of 2,3,4...):usually it descriped nested loops perfo. Ex: Bubble Sort, 2D arrays
4. O(2 power of n):usually it descriped recursion like Fibonacci 
5. O(log n):usually it descriped some search algo such as binary search
6. O(n log n): usually it descriped some sorting algos such as merge and quick sorts

# Names and Values in Python

**Rules for Python variables:**

1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name cannot start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

**to assign value to a variable:**
using assignment operator `=`

Ex:

     variableName = value
     x=3
     y='string'
     z= True
     array=[1,2,3]
     concat= "hello" +"world"


**loops:**
1. for loop

   Ex: 
          
          for i in array: 
          # do something
2. while


 Ex: 
          
          i = 1 # initialization
          while i < 6: # condition
          print(i)
          i += 1   # increment


**functions:**

Ex: 
          
          def functionName:
            # do something (block of code will be executed when the function called)


          def welcome:
            print("welcome^^")


         welcome()


***notes:***
1. name have scope but no type
2. values have types but no scope
