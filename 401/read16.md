we can break down applied machine learning into the following chunks:
1. exploratory analysis with `10%`
2. data cleaning with `20%`
3. feature engineering with `25%`
4. algorithm selection with `10%`
5. model training with `15%`
6. others with `20%`


## exploratory analysis
There’s a big challenge in data science called **Tactical Hell** This is actually a term from startups, and it’s when you have too many tactics to choose from

## data cleaning
If you have a clean dataset, even simple algorithms can learn impressive insights from it!

## feature engineering
feature engineering” is creating new model input features from your existing ones.

## algorithm selection
In applied machine learning, individual algorithms should be swapped in and out depending on which performs best for the problem and the dataset.

## model training
train your data

# machine learning

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
