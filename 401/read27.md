# Models in django

 Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc. 

 ## Fields

 A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type â€” each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value.

ex: 

    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')

## Common field arguments
1. help_text
2. verbose_name
3. default
4. null
5. blank
6. choices
7. primary_key: represent the table and it is a unique not repeated data (with it you can classify data)

## Common field types
1. CharField
2. TextField
3. IntegerField
4. DateField
5. EmailField
6. FileField and ImageField
7. AutoField is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments. 
8. ForeignKey: to make relation between tables (for one-to-many relationship)
