# State and Props

## what is component lifecycle?
methods that you are able to use on component are called lifecycle events.

## waht are the phases of component lifecycle?
1. Mounting: component is being created 
2. Updating: component is updated 
3. Unmounting: component is being removed

**notes:**
- constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted
- `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: This method exists where the state relies on changes in props over time.
- `render()`: Render is the only required method in a class component
- `componentDidMount()`:This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted


## there is 2 ways in react to handle/deal with data:
1. props:it is like the argument we pass it into the component to display it or initialize something by it (fixed not modified)
also preps you handle it and updated out-side the component.
2. state: it is always handle and updated inside the component (modified depend on some action).
