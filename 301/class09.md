1. **What is functional programming?**

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions.

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

The definition of a pure function is: The function always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed in

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**

One of the major benefits of using pure functions is they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments

4. **What is immutability?**

: not capable of or susceptible to change


5. **What is Referential transparency?**

is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value

# Modules and require()

1. **What is a module?**

are a major new feature, or rather a collection of new features.

2. **What does the word ‘require’ do?**

used to load and cache JavaScript modules.

3. **How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

we need to import the module. we will use the require keyword at the top of the file. The result of require is then stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation

4. **What do we have to do to make a module available?**

the first thing you do to get access to module features is export them. This is done using the export statement. You can export functions, var , let , const , and — as we'll see later — classes.
