# JavaScript (JS)
 is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles

 The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification

 **The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code**

 JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.

 #### Standard objects

by using  

 built-in objects Array, Boolean, Date, Error, Function, JSON, Math, Number, Object, RegExp, String, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet, and others.

#### Expressions and operators
by using

 JavaScript's operators instanceof, typeof, new, this, the operator precedence, and more.

#### Statements and declarations
by using:

 do-while, for-in, for-of, try-catch, let, var, const, if-else, switch, and more JavaScript statements and keywords work.
Functions

#### how to initialized inputs and declare it:
First name: <input id="first_name">

#### how to initialized outputs and declare it:
var fname = document.getElementById('first_name').value;

#### so in general how to declared variables:
There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

Using var
Using let
Using const

for ex: var x = 5;

**notes:** 
- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
- javaScript can handle many types of data
- if we write this statement without declare it its value will be undifined : var carName;
- we can re-declare variables
- JavaScript treats a dollar and underscore  sign as a letter
