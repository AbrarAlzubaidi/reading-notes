![GROWTH MINDSET](https://thetalentinstitute.imgix.net/assets/img/blog/wouter-blog.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=531.5625&q=80&w=945&s=222d9cc565e7ee7a3e343cf11038b026)

**Growth mindset** (GM) it means that developed your self by effort and work hard to get nice achievements.talent and intelligence are not the main key to be successful, they will give you an advantages and may be make it easier to you but not alone. if you put your hard work with your talent it will give you a great result.

Growth mindset is the opposite of Fixed mindset (FM) which see tha talent and intelligence are the basic and main elements to be successful, even if you try hard there is no effort to do that. *(for me this kind of think like a disease)*

SO, how i know if my mind/think is GM or FM? by check somethings and here some of them:

1. **challenges**:  GM-->will embraces you, you will acept it and challenge it ;) if the challenge is a problem you can face it, solve it and have fun :)

    FM---> you will avoid it easily because you think you are not against it.

 2. **effort**: GM--> show you there is no gain without pain amd sometime you have to feel pain to reach nice result.

    FM-->show this effort is pointless and there is no need for it.


    ####Finally####, you should think like GM and take it a rule in your life. And please stop thinking like FM this is a disease because you can do it with some more effort :)
